Pₓ is the amount prodced at month x.
Dₓ is the demand for month x.
Sₓ is the amount stored at the end of month x.
Rₓ is the amount ruined at the end of month x.

We minimize

15 ∑ Pₓ + .75 ∑ Sₓ + 25 ∑ Rₓ

subject to Pₓ ≥ Dₓ.

In month 3, we have 1950u saved. D₃ = 5000, D₃ > S₃ there wil be no units from month < 3 stored at month = 4. Thus Sₓ = Pₓ + .89 Sₓ₋₁ - Dₓ ∀x > 3.

Also, the amount ruined each month is Rₓ = .11 Sₓ₋₁ ∀x > 3.
